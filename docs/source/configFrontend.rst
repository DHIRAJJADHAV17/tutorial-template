   - After the bucket is created, go inside the bucket in the AWS Management Console.
   
   - Upload the build files and folders of the project. To build the project, run the following command:

8. Update the Bucket policy in Permissions 
  .. code-block:: json

     {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": "*",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetObject"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
                ]
            }
